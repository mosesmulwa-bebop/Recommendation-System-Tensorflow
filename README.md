This repo covers a Movie recommendation system using Collaborative filtering to learn Movie and User Embeddings. 
It uses the MovieLens Dataset which consists of movie rating from 1 to 5. <br>

## Outline
1. Exploring the MovieLens Data <br>
2. Preliminaries <br>
3. Training a matrix factorization model <br>
4. Inspecting the Embeddings <br>
5. Regularization in matrix factorization <br>
6. Softmax model training <br>
